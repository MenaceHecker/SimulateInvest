SimulateInvest README
Introduction
The world of finance is constantly evolving, presenting challenges for individual investors and organizations, particularly during times of market volatility. To empower investors with the tools and resources needed to navigate these uncertainties, we've developed SimulateInvest—a simple and user-friendly interface. Our platform aims to help users understand the impact of market volatility and make informed investment decisions, fostering a more confident and knowledgeable investment community.

What it does
SimulateInvest offers users insights into their investment plans across three distinct time intervals: past, present, and future.

Past:
Displays historical market data and trends for the chosen investment.
Calculates performance metrics including the Sharpe ratio, Alpha (α), and beta value.
Present:
Analyzes current market sentiment and prestige of the investment company by categorizing articles as positive or negative through semantic analysis.
Future:
Utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to project future market performance based on factors such as total return, price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield, and earnings growth.
How we built it
We leveraged Python and its libraries, including Pandas and NumPy, to collect historical investment data from Yahoo Finance API. This data is used to plot graphs, calculate performance metrics, and conduct sentiment analysis on news articles. Users have the flexibility to select their preferred investment company or stock.
The frontend and backend of the website were developed using React and Node.js.

Designed a model that incorporates key aspects of investment planning.
Successfully integrated Python-generated data and graphs into a functional website.
